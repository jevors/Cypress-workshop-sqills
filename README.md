# TODO App

## Setup

```bash
## clone this repo to a local directory
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/cypress-example-todomvc.git

## cd into the cloned repo
cd cypress-example-todomvc

## install the node_modules
npm install

## start the local webserver
npm start
```

The `npm start` script will launch a webserver on port `8888` which hosts the TODO app.
